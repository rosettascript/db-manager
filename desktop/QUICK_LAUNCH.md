# 🚀 Quick Launch Guide

Since the desktop icon might take a while to appear in your menu, here are the **fastest ways** to run your app:

## ⚡ Fastest Methods

### Method 1: Double-Click the Launcher (Easiest!)

In your file manager, navigate to:
```
desktop/dist/launch-dbmanager.sh
```

**Just double-click it!** The app will launch automatically.

### Method 2: Bookmark the Launcher

**Right-click** `desktop/dist/launch-dbmanager.sh` and:
- **Pin to favorites** (if your file manager supports it)
- **Add to bookmarks**
- **Create shortcut on Desktop**

Then you can launch it with one click!

### Method 3: Terminal (Quick Command)

```bash
~/CG3_Tech/Projects/Personal\ Project\ 2025/db-manager/desktop/dist/launch-dbmanager.sh
```

Or create an alias:
```bash
echo "alias dbmanager='~/CG3_Tech/Projects/Personal\ Project\ 2025/db-manager/desktop/dist/launch-dbmanager.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Now just type:
dbmanager
```

### Method 4: Create Desktop Shortcut Manually

1. Open your file manager
2. Navigate to `desktop/dist/`
3. **Right-click** on `launch-dbmanager.sh`
4. Select "Create Link" or "Send to Desktop"
5. Rename to "DB Manager"

Now you have a desktop icon!

## 🎯 Recommended: Method 1

The simplest is to just **bookmark the launcher script in your file manager** so it's always one click away!

## 💡 Why the Applications Menu Might Not Show It

Some desktop environments require:
- Log out/log in
- Restart
- Manual menu refresh

But **you don't need to wait** - just use the launcher script directly!

**Bottom line: Just double-click `launch-dbmanager.sh` and you're good to go!** 🎉
